    <h2> Why is sleep important </h2>
    <p> Sleep is crucial for overall health and well-being, supporting physical recovery, brain function, and mental health, while also impacting metabolism, immune function, and mood. </p>
    <p> Sleep deficiency is linked to many chronic health problems, including heart disease, kidney disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, stroke, obesity, and depression. Sleep deficiency is also linked to a higher chance of injury in adults, teens, and children.</p>
    <h2> How to tell if you're sleep deprived?</h2>
    <p>You might be sleep-deprived if you experience persistent fatigue, difficulty concentrating, mood swings, and reduced physical strength, along with other symptoms like frequent yawning and needing naps during the day. </p>
